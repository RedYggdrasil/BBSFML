BBSFML is a **2D Brick Breaker** game in development.
It is being developed for **Windows** as a Win32 app in **C++** using the **SFML 3.0** graphic library.

This project was done in December 2024 to serve as demonstration to a class of students in gamedev.
The art and audio assets are form **World of Warcraft** and **Hearthstone** by **Blizzard Entertainment**.

## Build
### Download Executable
There is a Release build of BBSFML on Google Drive [Download the file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15qYEEATBH6K5alJoBJ76l0f1m5TN40dy/view?usp=sharing).

### Run the Level Editor
Run **START_LEVEL_EDITOR.bat** or in comand line, run **App.exe**  with parameter **run_editor**



## BBSFML Branches
```main``` correspond to the project code up to date.


## Build BBSFML from sources
To build BBSFML from these sources, you need to : 

0. Git clone the complete solution (recursive clone).
1. Generate the visual studio solution.
2. Build the project.
3. Copy assets (should be done automatically by CMake).

### 0. Git clone the complete solution
**BBSFML depend on [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) for rendering and audio, [nlohmann's json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/) for json read/write operations and [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) for profiling._**\
 All are included into the visual studio project and built with BBSFML. **_To ensure your project is valid. please git clone recursively, as theses projects are linked via git submodule._**

### 1. Generate the visual studio solution
Generating the visual studio solution can be by either :
#### 1.a. Using the .bat files
Simply run **RegenerateAll.bat** at the project root. this will automatically run _CleanBuild.bat_ and then _Generate_CMake.bat_.

#### 1.b. Running Cmake in command line
Write these lines in your CLI with the current context being the project's root directory.
```
mkdir "Build"
cd Build
cmake ..
```

### 2. Build the project
Run the newly created ```./Build/BBSFML.sln``` and build the **App** project in **Debug** or **Release** for the **x64** platform.

### 3. Copy the _Assets_ folder in the build directory  (should be done automatically by CMake)
This should be automatically handled by CMake after a build on visual studio, if not  : 
run **CopyAssets.bat** at the project root
Or
Copy the ```./App/Assets``` folder to the newly generated ```./Build/App/Debug``` or ```./Build/App/Release``` folder, alonside the generated **App.exe** application (depending on if you build debug or release). 

This should result in a newly present **Assets** folder in the same directory as the **App.exe** application.


## BBSFML Build options
BBSFML can behave in various manners depending on a few CMake build options, these can be changed in the file ```.\App\CMake_Source\Public\Gen_App\Config.h.in```. Any change to this file will trigger a CMake visual studio solution regeneration during the next build.


### Use project _Assets_ folder vs build _Assets_ folder
The BBSFML app will use assets from either the project folder via using hard link generated by CMake, or locally, where the **App.exe** is located on the disk.

You can set **App.exe** to use _project_ Assets folder with the line :
```
#define USE_${APP_NAME}_PROJECT_ASSETS true
```

Alternatively you can set **App.exe** to use the local Assets folder with the line (default):
```
#define USE_${APP_NAME}_PROJECT_ASSETS false
```
